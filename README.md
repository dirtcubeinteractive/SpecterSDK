# Welcome to the Specter Unity SDK #

Welcome to the SpecterSDK for Unity documentation. This SDK is designed to empower Unity developers by providing 
a comprehensive suite of tools and APIs that enable the integration of advanced game functionalities, including 
authentication, in-game transactions, leaderboards, inventory management, and more, into your Unity projects. 
Whether you're developing an indie game or working on a major title, SpecterSDK aims to streamline your development 
process, enhance player engagement, and help monetize your game effectively.

## Documentation Links ##
We recommend going through at least the **Specter User Manual** before beginning integration and implementation
of the SDK into your game code. Here are links to get you going:
